                Bengali Boost was born in the weird times of 2020 when we found ourselves searching for community, masks and sanitizer, forgetting we were on mute, grappling with big issues like health, isolation, racism, and trying to figure out how our culture both helps us and hinders us. Despite the tough times we were inspired by the artists, innovators, storytellers and brave Bengalis who were and still are changing the world. Bengali Boost is about them and it's about figuring out what a future Bengali-diaspora culture could look like.
