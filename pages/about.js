              Bengali Boost was born in the weird times of 2020. After we stopped impulse-buying masks, sanitizer and toilet paper in bulk, we realized what we actually needed most was <span className="text-yellow font-bold">community.</span> <br/><br/> We were also grappling with big issues like health, racism, civic duty and trying to figure out how our <span className="text-yellow font-bold">culture</span> fits into it all. Despite the tough times we were inspired by the artists, innovators, storytellers and brave Bengalis making waves in the world. <br/><br/> Bengali Boost is about being recharged by their <span className="text-yellow font-bold">stories</span>, uplifting each other and figuring out what a future Bengali-diaspora culture could look like.
